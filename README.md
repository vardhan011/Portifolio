# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about running tests for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more details.

---

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!**

If you want full control over the build tools and configuration, you can run `npm run eject`.  
This will copy all the configuration files and dependencies into your project, allowing you to customize them.

Most users don’t need to eject — the default configuration works well for small to medium projects.
